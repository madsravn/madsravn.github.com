    <p>You can find my master thesis <a href="thesis.pdf">here</a>. You can find the code for my thesis <a href="https://github.com/madsravn/BIS">here</a>. I will continue to develop on the code at a later stage. I had some ideas for improvement I did not feel I had the time to implement before handing in. You can find the presentation I used for my defense <a href="defense.pdf">here</a>. The presentation was performed in Danish.</p>

    <p>I would like to thank my advisor for his ideas and help.</p>
