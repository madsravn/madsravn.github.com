      <h3> About the person </h3>
      <p> I love programming, reading, tinkering and spending time with my family.</p>
      <br />

      <p >
      I graduated from Aarhus University with a Master's degree in Computer Science. I focused mainly on programming languages and graphics programming. Currently I work as a freelance consultant.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p> I try to work on a few personal spare time projects. I feel it is important to find a hobby where you can grow. And while I get to work with exciting things during my work hours it is not always the technology I want to improve on I get to use. </p>
      <br />
      <p> Right now I am working on a CHIP-8 emulator in Rust </p>
