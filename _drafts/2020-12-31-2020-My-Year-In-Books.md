title: My year in books, 2020
---

Inspired by threads on Reddit, this is *My year in books, 2020*. I listen to most of my books. Or I listen to all of my fiction books, at least. I listen to books mostly when driving to and from work, going for a walk, going to sleep or doing menial tasks around the house or garden.

The genres I prefer are mostly fantasy, science fiction and crime. I listened to 46 books in 2020. 

### Fantasy

What really stood out, fantasy-wise, for me in the books I listened to in 2020 was *The Highwayman* by R.A. Salvatore, *Kings of the Wylde* by Nicholas Eames, *The Licanius Trilogy* by James Islington and *The Rage of Dragons* by Evan Winter.

A special shout out to Joe Abercrombie for the second book in the *Age of Madness Trilogy*. He really delivers! His books also have great re-read value.


### Science Fiction

This category also contains some letdowns. I read *The Foundation Trilogy* by Isaac Asimov. I love the romantic idea that Asimov have about the future - but in the end his series was quite boring. 

Timothy Zahn with a new Thrawn book - who wouldn't be super hyped for the first instalment of the new *Thrawn Ascendency*? I think I was too hyped because Thrawn already have a great trilogy in the *Thrawn Trilogy* and this really didn't do it justice! It was with a sad heart that I realized I probably will not listen to book two and three in this trilogy.


### Crime
