**Other clients**: You can use emoji names for your wifi network and it works
great if you connect to your base station with OS X Lion (and above), iPhone,
or iPad. But if you run a more diverse network you're going to run into
problems. Snow Leopard and earlier, for example, renders emoji as square boxes
since the OS just didn't understand emoji until Lion. Your Xbox 360 also won't
render emoji, but it seems to connect just fine. It appears that Windows
clients will refuse to connect to any emoji network name at all. Might be a
feature instead of a bug, though.
