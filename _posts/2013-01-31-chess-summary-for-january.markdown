title: Chess summary for January
---

Introduction
------------

Back in November I saw a video posted on Reddit. It was a video of an analysis of a chess game. This got me motivated to try playing chess and I really liked it. I also like numbers, so I have decided that I want to sum up each month of chess from now on. 

Unfortunately January has been a exam month, so the number of chess games are sort of scarce. But ...

The Numbers
-----------

So I made <a href="https://github.com/madsravn/pgn-divider/blob/master/divider.sh">a little script</a> to sort out the data from one big file of pgn annotation since chesscube will not let me download pgn files other than manually. From this I could deduce some statistics.

So I made some fancy charts with the help of <a href="http://www.chartgo.com">www.chartgo.com</a>.

I played 46 games in January. Luckily for my ego I won more than I lost.
