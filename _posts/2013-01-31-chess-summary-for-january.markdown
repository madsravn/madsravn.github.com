title: Chess summary for January
---

Introduction
------------

Back in November I saw a video posted on Reddit. It was a video of an analysis of a chess game. This got me motivated to try playing chess and I really liked it. I also like numbers, so I have decided that I want to sum up each month of chess from now on. 

Unfortunately January has been a exam month, so the number of chess games are sort of scarce. But I felt chess was a welcome distraction when I wanted a little breathing room from all the reading.

The Numbers
-----------

So I made <a href="https://github.com/madsravn/pgn-divider/blob/master/divider.sh">a little script</a> to sort out the data from one big file of pgn annotation since chesscube will not let me download pgn files other than manually. From this I could deduce some statistics.

So I made some fancy charts with the help of <a href="http://www.chartgo.com">www.chartgo.com</a>.

I played 46 games in January. Luckily for my ego I won more than I lost.

Unfortunately the game history chesscube saves only includes the rating of the players after the game. So I can make any analysis to whether players had higher or lower rating than me at the time of the game since if I had played a player near my rating and won he would probably have lower rating than me after the game. Of the 27 games I won only 3 of my opponents had a higher rating than me AFTER the game. So I think I can conclude that most of my victories were over players with a lower rating than my own.


In the end I went from 1326 to 1352 rating on chesscube. Even though I haven't really moved significantly up I feel like I have learned a lot from just playing and experiencing.

The conclusion
--------------

I really like playing chess. I like that the game doesn't include any form of randomness that many other games like card games and backgammon have. I also feel like I am training my concentration by playing and trying to think some moves ahead while keeping my head in current situation of the game.

I would like to thank <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Ruxistico/videos?view=0">Rune Friborg</a> for making the video who initially got me motivated to play. He also invited me to an awesome facebook group "Fucking Skak" (Fucking Chess) and then challenged me to a game and gave me an analysis of the game afterwards - this was an awesome start on my chess adventure. I'd also like to thank the awesome facebook group Fucking skak for constant motivation and chess news - this is the first facebook group I have been in which actually contributes content of very high quality!

And I cannot forget the huge impact both <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kingscrusher">kingcrusher</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/chess">/r/chess</a> have had on my game. Also both delivers good content on a regular basis!

It's obvious I have a long way to go and A LOT more games to play before I can call myself a decent chess player. But the journey there seems fun and the goal worthwhile.
