<b>First post with jekyll:</b><br />
<p>You can find more information about the jekyll engine on Github <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>here</a> <br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I have been following <a href='http://zachholman.com/'>Zach Holmans blog</a> for some time now and I eagerly been reading about his work at Github and what he feels is a hot topic on a given blog-post date. I came to admire him: Writing exciting stuff, working at github and having friendly and funny discussion on Twitter and at Hacker News.</p>

<p>I then did what others do when they strive to achieve: I imitated the person having what I wanted to have. I have borrowed the idea of using Jekyll on Github and the design of the blog from Zach - with permission of course. I have it a bit, though - my name instead of his name, some small details as sizes in the style and then <a href='http://evafrederiksen.blogspot.dk/'>my girlfriend</a> made some new icons for my menu since the ones Zach had weren&#8217;t free. <br /> My idea is to change the look and feel of the site gradually over time since design isn&#8217;t really my strong suit and right now I&#8217;m quite content with the look. But I can imagine that eventually I want a site which I have made mostly entirely myself instead of a site where only 10% of the design is my own. <br /></p>

<p>So what do I want to do with this site? I want to showcase my current projects, write about solutions to problems I encounter at school or at work, tell people about my interest and what I think could be a hot topic. I am recent convert to vim and I have also recently begun playing a great deal of chess, so I could imagine I am going to write some posts about that since I would both like to share my thoughts on those topic and get some input on my thoughts.</p>
