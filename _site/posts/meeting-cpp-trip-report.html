  <p>Last week I attended my first ever C++ conference. It was the Meeting C++ conference in Berlin. The conference was very nicely planned with some good speakers and good topics. There were only a few minor details which was inconvinient. Below I will try to express some thoughts about the different talks I saw and about the conference in general.</p>

<h2 id="the-keynote">The Keynote</h2>

<p>The keynote this year was presented by Bjarne Stroustrup. I have seen Bjarne a few times before and it never gets boring. He talked about what his thoughts were when he created C++ and how he is trying to stay true to those thoughts going into newer versions of C++. As always he talked expressing intent - both for the readers and the compiler. He then showed what kind of features we can expect from C++17 and what he hopes will come with C++2z. I am always impressed at the questions he gets and how he answers them. He is getting all kind of weird and technical questions and he answers them all in a very calm manner. There was one question he didn’t want to answer though, which was about which languages he likes and dislikes.</p>

<h2 id="all-your-cache-is-belong-to-us">All your cache is belong to us</h2>

<p>I also saw a talk about caches by Timur Doumler. It was very good. He had some excellent points accompanied by good figures and thought-out experiments. I never thought the subject of caching could become fun and interesting, but Doumler actually nailed it. Unfortunately, this presentation did not allow for questions due to time being short. This was the one single talk I had a question for. He also showed snippets of code as to how you would write better code if you are interested in cache friendliness.</p>

<h2 id="a-million-lines-of-code">A million lines of code</h2>

<p>Next on the schedule was Peter Bindels from Tomtom talking about their own software. He talked about how they had had problems with way too many lines of codes. He presented some guidelines for how to handle it and talked about a tool Tomtom had developed to show internal code dependencies. This tool had been very successfull in helping them make their code more clear and expressive. He mentioned that their tool could find code dependency cycles and how you did want to have these. I found this talk very good. Peter was very engaging and talked about practical experience which is easy to convert into your own work.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-dash-of-functional">A little dash of functional</h2>

<p>The last talk of the day was Phil Nash with his ‘Functional C++ for Fun and Profit’. I was a little vary when joining this talk. Sometimes when people talk about functional C++ it just becomes a garbage can of metaprogramming. Nash had none of this. His talk was concise with some very nice points from his practical experience. He showed how to express intent with functional programming and how to strive towards the idea of purity. He talked a little about some persistent data structure before showing how to make some nice functional programming with lambda expressions and <code class="language-html highlighter-rouge">std::optional</code>. It was very intereting. This was easily the best talk of the day for me.</p>

<h2 id="party-time">Party time!</h2>

<p>At this point we got some food. It was OK - nothing too good. And there was no beer with the meal! However, after the meal there was a C++ quiz by conan.io. It was very fun to try. We did OK, I think we got 5-6th place or something. After the quiz, at 9:00 PM the beer finally arrived. I went around, drank some beer and talked to some interesting people! This was also one of the best things about the conference: just talking to people about stuff. Too bad we only had one evening to do that. But next years Meeting C++ with one more day of conference will be better!</p>

<h2 id="saturday-morning-functional-programming">Saturday morning functional programming</h2>

<p>First thing on the schedule saturday was ‘Functional Reactive Programming in C++’ by Ivan Cukic. I have to give it to Cukic for bringing a very relevant and easy to use presentation! Again, I had expected some metaprogramming, but it was good on the conceptual level as to how you want to explore funcation reactive programming! Was an excellent presentation. Cukic also shared free copies of his future book on this exact subject!</p>

<h2 id="static-analysis">Static analysis!</h2>

<p>Next up was Gabor Horvath with his talk about static analysis. Gabor is a PhD student with subject in static analysis, so this talk was a little academic. But it was indeed very interesting. He had good examples and nice slides on the subject. When the presentation was over I was much more curious about static analysis and wanted to look more into it. This was also one of my favorite talks of the conference.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I didn’t get to see the closing keynote due to my travel plans. I had to get home. But that was OK - I had had an awesome first conference. I am very inspired about the things I learned there. I can feel there are a lot of things I still need to learn and I look forward to this! I got to speak with some interesting people and share laughs with others! I hope I can take some of the subjects I heard about and incorporate them into my work.</p>

<p>This was all in all a good conference and an awesome experience!</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/contributing-to-clang">Contributing to Clang</a></h2>
      <p>A year or so ago I started contributing code to Clang. For those of you who doesn’t know what <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> is; it is a C and C++ front-end for LLVM. In short, a C++ compiler. I have mostly been doing work on <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/">Clang-Tidy</a> which is a Clang-based C++ linter. It can help you find errors, enforce coding guidelines or modernize your project. it is a very helpful tool which can be an effective part of your tool chain. It is also very easy to extend Clang-Tidy with your own checks - and it also easy to have this code accepted into the official Clang project.</p>

      <p>I graduated from Aarhus University with a degree in Computer Science this june. Now, I’m finally getting around to publishing my code (as I linked in my thesis). I thought that I would give a quick summary of the process of writing my thesis as well. You can find my thesis and the code I developed for my thesis <a href="./../../BIS/index.html">here</a>. The title of my thesis is Orthogonal Range Searching in 2D with Ball Inheritance and my advisor was <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~larsen/">Kasper Green Larsen</a>.</p>

      <p>With the two new consoles being released soon, there is a lot of hype about it online. There is a lot of articles online describing the differences in performance, games, design and usability - reading the comparisons of the consoles almost seems like a bigger time consumption than actually playing on the console.</p>

      <p>I like graphics and image processing. So I have been fiddling a little with NVIDIAs CUDA in order to capatilize on some multithreaded programming. I have made a little starter edition for people who wants to try forces with CUDA for image processing.</p>

      <p>On a day like January 1st I mostly like relaxing in front of the TV with some movies or series and I had been looking forward to it. I got a powered USB hub for Christmas since our external hard drive, a Verbatim N446, is USB powered and the Raspberry doesn’t provide enough power for it. So we plugged in our new USB hub and plugged the drive to that. Discovery and mounting went fine, but when we started watching something it would take 3 seconds before it would start to buffer - it actually used more time buffered than playing.</p>

      <p>Many people today listen to music on the go - to work, to school or just between places.  When I look around on any given day most people either have ear plugs in their ears or headphones over them.  Some people actually play so loud that you can just behind them and enjoy their music for free, while others I look at and wonder what they’re playing.</p>
