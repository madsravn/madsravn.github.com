  <p>Many people today listen to music on the go - to work, to school or just between places.  When I look around on any given day most people either have ear plugs in their ears or headphones over them.  Some people actually play so loud that you can just behind them and enjoy their music for free, while others I look at and wonder what they’re playing.</p>

<p>I used to listen to music myself back in the days. However, I tend to hear the same songs too much in a small period of time and then I get sick of them. This trend of mine required me to swap my music out on a regular basis and I am not really good at finding new music, and not in that small amount of time. So instead I started listening to radio. We have a pretty good radio station here in Denmark, called <a href="https://www.dr.dk/p3">P3</a>. The talk a bit… quite a lot actually and I quickly realized I liked the parts with people talking more than I liked their mainstream pop (and Danish pop really sucks), so I decided to try an audiobook instead. I started out with a book which had been on my to-reread list for a while: Sun Tzus Art of War.</p>

<p>It worked out great. The book was quickly “read” since I usually walk home from school or work instead of taking the bus because I find it relaxing to just walk, get some air and not think of work/school before I come home and start working on the weekly handins. So I went on listening to some more books - I found that I enjoyed non-fiction over fiction when listening to an audiobook while normally I like both genres. The latest book I heard was Atul Gawandes The Checklist Manifesto which actually exceeded my expectations: It was exciting and I learned a bit from it.</p>

<p>But then some weeks ago I decided to re-watch <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/Keynote-Bjarne-Stroustrup-Cpp11-Style">Bjarne Stroustrups keynote from GoingNative 2012</a> since I liked some of the ideas for style that he presented. Then I noticed that you could download the talk in MP3 (Audio only). I then thought to myself that I would just listen to it on my way home from school the day after. It was just as good - an audio-only version of Bjarne was plenty. So when I got home I went online to <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com">channel9.msdn.com</a> to see what else there was. There’s a lot of very nice talks, interviews and such on there. Since I programming languages and that sort of stuff I mainly browse <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep">Going Deep</a> for videos I want to hear when I walk home. Lately I heard the interview Anders Hejlsberg and Lars Bak talking about <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Anders-Hejlsberg-and-Lars-Bak-TypeScript-JavaScript-and-Dart">Typescript, Javascript and Dart</a> since we’re covering all three languages in a course in school so I thought I could learn a little extra about it anyways. It was very exciting as well.</p>

<p>I’m fairly sure I’m not the inventor of this concept. I just found out about it myself and I’m enjoying myself with it. I can warmly recommend it. So what do you listen to?</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/contributing-to-clang">Contributing to Clang</a></h2>
      <p>A year or so ago I started contributing code to Clang. For those of you who doesn’t know what <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> is; it is a C and C++ front-end for LLVM. In short, a C++ compiler. I have mostly been doing work on <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/">Clang-Tidy</a> which is a Clang-based C++ linter. It can help you find errors, enforce coding guidelines or modernize your project. it is a very helpful tool which can be an effective part of your tool chain. It is also very easy to extend Clang-Tidy with your own checks - and it also easy to have this code accepted into the official Clang project.</p>

      <p>Last week I attended my first ever C++ conference. It was the Meeting C++ conference in Berlin. The conference was very nicely planned with some good speakers and good topics. There were only a few minor details which was inconvinient. Below I will try to express some thoughts about the different talks I saw and about the conference in general.</p>

      <p>I graduated from Aarhus University with a degree in Computer Science this june. Now, I’m finally getting around to publishing my code (as I linked in my thesis). I thought that I would give a quick summary of the process of writing my thesis as well. You can find my thesis and the code I developed for my thesis <a href="./../../BIS/index.html">here</a>. The title of my thesis is Orthogonal Range Searching in 2D with Ball Inheritance and my advisor was <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~larsen/">Kasper Green Larsen</a>.</p>

      <p>With the two new consoles being released soon, there is a lot of hype about it online. There is a lot of articles online describing the differences in performance, games, design and usability - reading the comparisons of the consoles almost seems like a bigger time consumption than actually playing on the console.</p>

      <p>I like graphics and image processing. So I have been fiddling a little with NVIDIAs CUDA in order to capatilize on some multithreaded programming. I have made a little starter edition for people who wants to try forces with CUDA for image processing.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/raspberry-with-slow-external-hard-drive">Raspberry Pi with slow external hard drive</a></h2>
      <p>On a day like January 1st I mostly like relaxing in front of the TV with some movies or series and I had been looking forward to it. I got a powered USB hub for Christmas since our external hard drive, a Verbatim N446, is USB powered and the Raspberry doesn’t provide enough power for it. So we plugged in our new USB hub and plugged the drive to that. Discovery and mounting went fine, but when we started watching something it would take 3 seconds before it would start to buffer - it actually used more time buffered than playing.</p>

      <p><b>First post with jekyll:</b> This is my first post with the jekyll engine. While I have yet to understand all the wonders of it, I find it most awesome.
You can find more information about the jekyll engine on Github <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">here</a>. I am also using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">this short overview</a> to learn the markdown syntax used by Github to render the pages on github pages.</p>
