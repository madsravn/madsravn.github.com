   <title>Chess summary for January</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in November I saw a video posted on Reddit. It was a video of an analysis of a chess game. This got me motivated to try playing chess and I really liked it. I also like numbers, so I have decided that I want to sum up each month of chess from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately January has been a exam month, so the number of chess games are sort of scarce. But I felt chess was a welcome distraction when I wanted a little breathing room from all the reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/madsravn/pgn-divider/blob/master/divider.sh&quot;&gt;a little script&lt;/a&gt; to sort out the data from one big file of pgn annotation since chesscube will not let me download pgn files other than manually. From this I could deduce some statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a fancy chart with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chartgo.com&quot;&gt;www.chartgo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://madsravn.dk/images/chess1.png&quot; alt=&quot;games&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played 46 games in January. Luckily for my ego I won more than I lost. I won nearly the same amount of games playing white as I did playing black. A fun difference is noticeable in the games I lost: I only lost 6 games as white compared to the 12 games I lost as black. Of course only having played 46 games this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like a big leap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the game history chesscube saves only includes the rating of the players after the game. So I can make any analysis to whether players had higher or lower rating than me at the time of the game since if I had played a player near my rating and won he would probably have lower rating than me after the game. Of the 27 games I won only 3 of my opponents had a higher rating than me AFTER the game. So I think I can conclude that most of my victories were over players with a lower rating than my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I went from 1326 to 1352 rating on chesscube. Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t really moved significantly up I feel like I have learned a lot from just playing and experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had imagined I could have made more charts (Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love charts?), but seeing that I can&amp;rsquo;t do any analysis of the ratings, it seems futile to make charts of more than just win/lose. If you have any idea what I can of further analysis with data given in a pgn file containing the rating after the game, please let me know. You can see how what kind of data is in the chesscube pgn in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/madsravn/pgn-divider/blob/master/january-2013.pgn&quot;&gt;January PGN chunk here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like playing chess. I like that the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t include any form of randomness that many other games like card games and backgammon have. I also feel like I am training my concentration by playing and trying to think some moves ahead while keeping my head in current situation of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/Ruxistico/videos?view=0&quot;&gt;Rune Friborg&lt;/a&gt; for making the video who initially got me motivated to play. He also invited me to an awesome facebook group &amp;ldquo;Fucking Skak&amp;rdquo; (Fucking Chess) and then challenged me to a game and gave me an analysis of the game afterwards &amp;ndash; this was an awesome start on my chess adventure. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to thank the awesome facebook group Fucking skak for constant motivation and chess news. The people in the group seems like good and dedicated players and this is the first facebook group I have been in which actually contributes content of very high quality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I cannot forget the huge impact both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/kingscrusher&quot;&gt;kingcrusher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/chess&quot;&gt;/r/chess&lt;/a&gt; have had on my game. Both definitely delivers good content on a regular basis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s obvious I have a long way to go and A LOT more games to play before I can call myself a decent chess player. But the journey there seems fun and the goal worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Raspberry Pi with slow external hard drive</title>
   <link href="http://madsravn.dk/posts/raspberry-with-slow-external-hard-drive"/>
   <updated>2013-01-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://madsravn.dk/posts/raspberry-with-slow-external-hard-drive</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a day like January 1st I mostly like relaxing in front of the TV with some movies or series and I had been looking forward to it. I got a powered USB hub for Christmas since our external hard drive, a Verbatim N446, is USB powered and the Raspberry doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide enough power for it. So we plugged in our new USB hub and plugged the drive to that. Discovery and mounting went fine, but when we started watching something it would take 3 seconds before it would start to buffer &amp;ndash; it actually used more time buffered than playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;hdparm -tT /dev/sda&lt;/code&gt; showed some disturbing news:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/sda:
Timing cached reads:   160 MB in  2.02 seconds =  79.35 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  14 MB in 33.51 seconds = 427.79 kB/sec
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No way we could watch a movie with 428 kB/sec. A little internet research showed that our Raspberry Pi atleast treats it&amp;rsquo;s USB ports as a USB hub already and when connecting a new one only the four first ports are given decent speed. Checking &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt; I saw it might make sense since the Raspberry had two entries for &amp;ldquo;USB-2.0 4-Port HUB&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bus 001 Device 005: ID 05e3:0608 Genesys Logic, Inc. USB-2.0 4-Port HUB
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 05e3:0608 Genesys Logic, Inc. USB-2.0 4-Port HUB
Bus 001 Device 008: ID 18a5:0237 Verbatim, Ltd Portable Harddrive (500 GB)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this weird and with a disbelief I tried swapping my external drive to the first port on the hub. &lt;code&gt;hdparm -tT /dev/sdb&lt;/code&gt; revealed it was working much better now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb:
Timing cached reads:   154 MB in  2.00 seconds =  77.01 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  40 MB in  3.10 seconds =  12.89 MB/sec
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an increase in speed with a factor 30 was pretty convincing. I tried comparing this speed to the speed on the Raspberrys SD card&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Timing cached reads:   162 MB in  2.02 seconds =  80.26 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  52 MB in  3.03 seconds =  17.17 MB/sec
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which shows that now the external drives speed was now close enough to decent speed. Happily we could now lie lifeless on the couch for some hours watching some mindless stuff :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this can help others to try this simple solution before going the tech-route with installing and configuring a bunch of needless stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi Model B rev. 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbatim N446&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust 7 Port USB2 Powered Hub (HU-5870V)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Music or audiobooks or ...</title>
   <link href="http://madsravn.dk/posts/music-or-audiobooks-or"/>
   <updated>2012-12-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://madsravn.dk/posts/music-or-audiobooks-or</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many people today listen to music on the go &amp;ndash; to work, to school or just between places.  When I look around on any given day most people either have ear plugs in their ears or headphones over them.  Some people actually play so loud that you can just behind them and enjoy their music for free, while others I look at and wonder what they&amp;rsquo;re playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to listen to music myself back in the days. However, I tend to hear the same songs too much in a small period of time and then I get sick of them. This trend of mine required me to swap my music out on a regular basis and I am not really good at finding new music, and not in that small amount of time. So instead I started listening to radio. We have a pretty good radio station here in Denmark, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dr.dk/p3&quot;&gt;P3&lt;/a&gt;. The talk a bit&amp;hellip; quite a lot actually and I quickly realized I liked the parts with people talking more than I liked their mainstream pop (and Danish pop really sucks), so I decided to try an audiobook instead. I started out with a book which had been on my to-reread list for a while: Sun Tzus Art of War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked out great. The book was quickly &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; since I usually walk home from school or work instead of taking the bus because I find it relaxing to just walk, get some air and not think of work/school before I come home and start working on the weekly handins. So I went on listening to some more books &amp;ndash; I found that I enjoyed non-fiction over fiction when listening to an audiobook while normally I like both genres. The latest book I heard was Atul Gawandes The Checklist Manifesto which actually exceeded my expectations: It was exciting and I learned a bit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then some weeks ago I decided to re-watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/Keynote-Bjarne-Stroustrup-Cpp11-Style&quot;&gt;Bjarne Stroustrups keynote from GoingNative 2012&lt;/a&gt; since I liked some of the ideas for style that he presented. Then I noticed that you could download the talk in MP3 (Audio only). I then thought to myself that I would just listen to it on my way home from school the day after. It was just as good &amp;ndash; an audio-only version of Bjarne was plenty. So when I got home I went online to &lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com&quot;&gt;channel9.msdn.com&lt;/a&gt; to see what else there was. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of very nice talks, interviews and such on there. Since I programming languages and that sort of stuff I mainly browse &lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep&quot;&gt;Going Deep&lt;/a&gt; for videos I want to hear when I walk home. Lately I heard the interview Anders Hejlsberg and Lars Bak talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Anders-Hejlsberg-and-Lars-Bak-TypeScript-JavaScript-and-Dart&quot;&gt;Typescript, Javascript and Dart&lt;/a&gt; since we&amp;rsquo;re covering all three languages in a course in school so I thought I could learn a little extra about it anyways. It was very exciting as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the inventor of this concept. I just found out about it myself and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying myself with it. I can warmly recommend it. So what do you listen to?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First post with Jekyll</title>
   <link href="http://madsravn.dk/posts/first-post"/>
   <updated>2012-10-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://madsravn.dk/posts/first-post</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First post with jekyll:&lt;/b&gt; This is my first post with the jekyll engine. While I have yet to understand all the wonders of it, I find it most awesome.
You can find more information about the jekyll engine on Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am also using &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;this short overview&lt;/a&gt; to learn the markdown syntax used by Github to render the pages on github pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been following &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/&quot;&gt;Zach Holmans blog&lt;/a&gt; for some time now and I eagerly been reading about his work at Github and what he feels is a hot topic on a given blog-post date. I came to admire him: Writing exciting stuff, working at github and having friendly and funny discussion on Twitter and at Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then did what others do when they strive to achieve: I imitated the person having what I wanted to have. I have borrowed the idea of using Jekyll on Github and the design of the blog from Zach &amp;ndash; with permission of course. I have it a bit, though &amp;ndash; my name instead of his name, some small details as sizes in the style and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://evafrederiksen.blogspot.dk/&quot;&gt;my girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; made some new icons for my menu since the ones Zach had weren&amp;rsquo;t free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea is to change the look and feel of the site gradually over time since design isn&amp;rsquo;t really my strong suit and right now I&amp;rsquo;m quite content with the look. But I can imagine that eventually I want a site which I have made mostly entirely myself instead of a site where only 10% of the design is my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I want to do with this site? I want to showcase my current projects, write about solutions to problems I encounter at school or at work, tell people about my interest and what I think could be a hot topic. I am recent convert to vim and I have also recently begun playing a great deal of chess, so I could imagine I am going to write some posts about that since I would both like to share my thoughts on those topic and get some input on my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
